    "## Disease Prediction Using Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we build a classification model to **predict the disease (prognosis)** based on a patient's symptoms, weather conditions, and other features such as age and gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Why Classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "This task is a classic **supervised learning problem**: we have input features and a known output label (`prognosis`). Classification allows us to train a model that can learn from historical cases and make accurate predictions on new patient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- If a patient presents with **headache, vomiting, and high temperature**, the model may predict a high probability of **Migraine**.\n",
    "- If a patient has **chest pain, high blood pressure, and humidity is high**, it might predict **Heart Attack**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These predictions could support **clinical decision-making**, early detection, or patient triage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîó How Pattern Mining Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we used pattern mining (FP-Growth) to identify frequent symptom combinations linked to specific diseases. Those patterns help:\n",
    "- Highlight **strong symptom-disease associations** (e.g., `{headache, vomiting} ‚Üí Migraine`)\n",
    "- Guide **feature importance awareness** before modeling\n",
    "- Validate whether the model is learning similar relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Why Not Clustering or Outlier Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering** is unsupervised and used to explore hidden groupings ‚Äî but we already know the disease labels.\n",
    "- **Outlier detection** identifies rare or unusual data points ‚Äî useful for anomaly detection, not disease prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **classification** is the most appropriate and effective approach for our goal.\n"
