# The insight we can make from here is that the PCA component for 1st Principle comonent and 2nd component takes 16.57% of the total data. This shows that first two PCs capture 16.6% of the total variability. This is not very high as we can say the variability is meaningful when 1st and 2nd PC taks 75~90% of the data.
# In conclusion, this indicates that even though PC1 and PC2 are useful, other data cannot be ignored.
