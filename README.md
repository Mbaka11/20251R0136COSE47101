# Weather-Based Disease Outbreak Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This is the term project for **COSE471: Data Science** at Korea University (Spring 2025).  
The goal is to predict disease outbreaks using historical weather data and uncover frequent weather patterns that contribute to such events.

We apply concepts from the course such as:

- **Classification** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)
- **Pattern Mining** (FP-Growth, Association Rules)
- *(Optional)* Outlier Detection and Clustering
